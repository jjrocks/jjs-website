			<h3>A newsletter made from 40 different countries for a game with over 1 million people.</h3>

			<div class="despcription">
				osu!Monthly was a magazine made for the popular game "<a href="http://osu.ppy.sh">osu!</a>". It was created with the intention of providing a detailed look at the community. The magazine at first was placed within the forums of osu! By the last edition it was featured in a news block on the main page.<br><br>

				The team was co-founded and lead by me. The team started with about 10-15 people over a few countries. Each week we met to talk about the next edition.  By the end our staff had 40 member across 5 continents with several teams creating different sections. Below is a list of osu!Monthly articles
