				osu!Monthly was a magazine made for the popular game <a href="http://osu.ppy.sh">"osu!"</a>. It was created with the intention of providing a detailed look at the community. The magazine at first was placed within the forums of osu! By the last edition it was featured in a news block on the main page.<br><br>

				The team was co-founded and lead by me. The team started with about 10-15 people over a few countries. Each week we met to talk about the next edition.  By the end our staff had 40 member across 5 continents with several teams creating different sections. Below is a list of osu!Monthly articles
